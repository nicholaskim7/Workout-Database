**Workout-Database**

**prerequisites:**
in workoutlog.py
1. Download Tkinter library
2. Import sqlite3
3. Uncomment lines 17-23 to create your table (after the first run you will have your table in your database and you can comment it out again)

**Usage:**
1. After you created your table in step 3 of prerequisites and commented it out run workoutLog.py
2. Enter in data for your workouts and add them to data-base

**Functionality:**
1. Add new workout
2. Show all workouts
3. Show workouts by a specific date
4. Edit workout info (enter unique id in the select id entry and update info)
5. Delete workout (enter unique id in the select id entry and show all workouts after. It will be gone)
6. Show current Personal Records which shows your max weight lifted for each exercise present in the database
7. Scrollbar for ease of use when database gets large
8. Randomized daily quotes for motivation. Every time the application is re-opened a random quote from a hand-full will be selected.

**Why I made this app:**
1. It is difficult to find a workout tracker application that will fit strictly to my needs
2. I wanted to avoid the premium fees and advertisements present on most workout trackers
3. Made it easy to use and most importantly not overly complicated.
