"# Workout-Database" 

**prerequisites:**

2. Import sqlite3
3. Uncomment lines 17-23 to create your table (after the first run you will have your table in your database and you can comment it out again)

**Usage:**

2. Show all workouts
3. Show workouts by a specific date
4. Edit workout info (enter unique id in the select id entry and update info)

**Why I made this app:**
1. It is difficult to find a workout tracker application that will fit strictly to my needs
2. I wanted to avoid the premium fees and advertisements present on most workout trackers
3. Made it easy to use and most importantly not overly complicated.
